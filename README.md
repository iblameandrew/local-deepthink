# local-deepthink: Democratizing Deep Thought üß†

I've been thinking a lot about how we, as people, develop ideas. It's rarely a single, brilliant flash of insight. Our minds are shaped by the countless small interactions we have throughout the day‚Äîa conversation here, an article there. This environment of constant, varied input seems just as important as the act of thinking itself.

I wanted to see if I could recreate a small-scale version of that "soup" required for true insight for local LLMs. The result is this project, **local-deepthink**. It's a system that runs a novel conceptual algorithm called a **Qualitative Neural Network (QNN)**. In a QNN, different AI agents are treated like "neurons" that collaborate and critique each other to refine ideas, effectively trading slower response times for higher quality and more comprehensive outputs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha Software - We Need Your Help! ‚ö†Ô∏è
Please be aware that local-deepthink is currently in an alpha stage. It is experimental research software. You may encounter bugs, unexpected behavior, or breaking changes.

Your feedback is invaluable. If you run into a crash or have ideas, please **open an issue** on our GitHub repository with your graph monitor trace log. Helping us identify and squash bugs is one of the most important contributions you can make right now!

## **Is true "deep thinking" only for trillion-dollar companies?**

**local-deepthink** is a research platform that challenges the paradigm of centralized, proprietary AI. While systems like Google's DeepMind offer powerful reasoning by giving their massive models more "thinking time" in a closed environment (for a high price), local-deepthink explores a different path: **emergent intelligence on affordable local hardware**. We simulate a society of AI agents that collaborate, evolve, and deepen their understanding collectively over time.

Essentially, you can think of this project as a way to **max out a model's performance by trading response time for quality**. The best part is that you don't need a supercomputer. local-deepthink is designed to turn even a modest 32gb RAM CPU-only laptop into a powerful "thought mining" rig. üíª‚õèÔ∏è By leveraging efficient local models, you can leave the network running for hours or even days, allowing it to "mine" a sophisticated solution to a hard problem. It's a fundamental shift: trading brute-force, instantaneous computation for the power of time, iteration, and distributed collaboration.

## Use Cases
The **Qualitative Neural Network (QNN)** algorithm that powers this system is great for problems where the only clue you have is a vague question or for one-shotting very long prompting sessions. Best part? You can now export the QNN into a JSON file and take it with you at the weight of only megabytes and plug it somewhere else to whatever LLM you like. If you create an RPG world, you could export its QNN and have other people prompt it.

*   **For Non-Programmers: Ultra-Long Creative Generation**
    Think of local-deepthink as a way to handle prompts that require ultra-long or deeply creative outputs. Do you want to theory-craft a complex system or design the lore of an entire RPG world? Normally, this requires prompting a model repeatedly and figuring out different system prompts. With local-deepthink, you give the system a high-level goal, and the QNN figures out the rest. At the end of the run, it delivers a comprehensive, queryable knowledge base, and an interrogator chain can use your points of interest to generate an exhaustive final report.

*   **For Programmers & Researchers: Full Stack App Generation**
    

## Changelog

*   **QNN Export/Import:** You can now export the entire state of a trained agent network (QNN) to a JSON file. This QNN can be imported and used for inference on new problems without rerunning the entire epoch process.
*   **Code Generation & Sandbox:** The system can now generate, synthesize, and safely execute Python code. A new `code_execution` node validates the final code, and successful modules provide context for future epochs.
*   **Interactive RAG Chat & Diagnostic Tool:** The process now pauses after the final epoch, allowing you to directly **chat with the generated RAG index**. This powerful diagnostic feature lets you interrogate the massive "cube of thinking text" from all hidden layers, ask follow-up questions, and gain extra insights.
*   **Final Knowledge Harvest & RAG:** The run now archives all agent outputs into a multi-layered RAPTOR index. Upon completion, `interrogator` and `paper_formatter` agents use this RAG index to write a formal academic-style paper answering expert-level questions about the problem.
*   **Dynamic Problem Re-framing:** The network can now assess its own progress. After each cycle (epoch), it formulates a new, more advanced problem that builds upon its previous solution, forcing the agents to continuously deepen their understanding.
*   **Divide and Conquer - Automatic Problem Decomposition:** local-deepthink now starts by breaking down the user's initial problem into smaller, granular sub-problems, assigning each agent a unique piece of the puzzle.
*   **Perplexity Metrics & Chart:** A `metrics` node calculates the average perplexity of all agent outputs after each epoch, plotted on a live chart in the GUI.
*   **Dynamic Summarization:** A specialized chain now automatically creates a concise summary of an agent's older memories if its memory log gets too long, preserving key insights while managing context length.

## The Core Idea: Qualitative Backpropagation

The core experiment is the **Qualitative Neural Network (QNN)**, an algorithm inspired by backpropagation in traditional neural networks. It's a numerical algorithm, of course, but what if the principle could be applied qualitatively? Instead of sending back a numerical error signal, you send back a "reflection."

After the network produces a solution, a "reflection pass" analyzes the result and **automatically re-writes the core system prompts** of the agents that contributed. The goal is for the network to "learn" from its own output over multiple cycles (epochs), refining not just its answers, but its own internal structure and approach. QNNs are also extremely human-interpretable, unlike their numerical counterparts.

### The Trade-Off: Speed for Depth

The obvious trade-off here is speed. A 6-layer network with 6 agents per layer, running for 20 epochs, can easily take 12 hours to complete. You're trading quick computation for a slow, iterative process of refinement. The algorithm excels in problems where creativity and insight override pure precision, like developing new frameworks in the social sciences.

## The QNN Algorithm: From Individual Agents to a Collective Mind

The core of local-deepthink is the novel QNN algorithm that orchestrates LLM agents into a dynamic, layered network. This architecture facilitates a "forward pass" for problem-solving, a "reflection pass" for learning, and a final "harvest pass" for knowledge extraction.

### The Forward Pass

In a QNN, the "weights" and "biases" of the network are not numerical values but the rich, descriptive personas of its agents, defined in natural language.

1.  **Input Layer & Decomposition**: The process starts with a user's high-level problem. A `master strategist` node first **decomposes this problem into smaller, distinct sub-problems**. These are then assigned to the first layer of agents.
2.  **Building Depth with Dense Layers**: A `dense-spanner` chain analyzes the agents of the preceding layer and spawns a new agent in the next layer, specifically engineered to tackle a tailored challenge.
3.  **Action**: A user's prompt initiates a cascade of information through the network until the final layer is reached, constituting a full "forward pass" of collaborative inference.

### The Reflection Pass: Learning Through Evolving Goals

This is where a QNN truly differs from a simple multi-agent system. Instead of simply correcting errors, the network learns by continuously raising the bar.

1.  **Synthesis and Metrics**: A `synthesis_node` merges the final outputs into a single solution, and a `metrics_node` calculates a perplexity score for the epoch.
2.  **Problem Re-framing**: The core of the learning loop. A `problem_reframer` node analyzes the synthesized solution and formulates a new, more ambitious problem that represents the "next logical step." This prevents the network from stagnating and pushes it toward deeper insights.
3.  **Decomposition of the New Problem**: The newly framed problem is then broken down again into a new set of granular sub-problems.
4.  **Updating the "Neural" Weights**: This new set of sub-problems is propagated backward through the network. An `update_agent_prompts_node` modifies each agent's core system prompt to align with its new, more advanced task for the next epoch.

### The Final Harvest Pass: Consolidating Knowledge

1.  **Archival and RAG Indexing**: All agent outputs from every epoch are used to build a comprehensive RAPTOR RAG index.
2.  **Pause for Interactive Chat & Diagnosis**: The network pauses, allowing you to directly query the RAG index. Because QNNs are highly interpretable, you can even diagnose a specific "neuron" by asking the chat about `agent_1_1` to get that specific agent's entire history.
3.  **Interrogation and Synthesis**: When you're done, your chat is added to the knowledge base. An `interrogator` agent then formulates expert-level questions about the original problem based on your points of interest.
4.  **Generating the Final Report**: A `paper_formatter` agent uses the RAG index to answer these questions, synthesizing the information into formal research papers. The final output is a downloadable ZIP archive of this report.

## Vision & Long-Term Roadmap: Training a World Language Model

Every local-deepthink run generates a complete, structured trace of a multi-agent collaborative process‚Äîa dataset capturing the evolution of thought. With the new export feature, these QNN JSON files can now be collected. We see this as **powerful, multi-dimensional data for training next-generation reasoning models.**

Our ultimate objective is to use this data to train a true **"World Language Model" (WLM)**. A WLM would move beyond predicting the next token to understanding the fundamental patterns of collaboration, critique, and collective intelligence. The exciting possibility is that fine-tuning a model on thousands of these QNN logs might make static system prompts obsolete, as the trained LLM would learn to implicitly figure them out and dynamically switch its reasoning process on the fly.

## Mid-Term Research Goals & How You Can Help
This is still alpha software, and we need your help. Besides the value you get after "mining" a solution, it's also super entertaining to watch the neurons interact with each other! If you have the hardware, please consider helping us benchmark.

*   **Hunt Bugs**: If you run into a crash, please open an issue with your graph monitor trace log.
*   **Deep Runs & Benchmarking**: I don't have access to systems like Google's DeepMind, so it would be fantastic if someone with a powerful local rig could run and benchmark moderate-to-large QNNs.
*   **Thinking Models Support**: Help integrate support for dedicated "thinking models".
*   **P2P Networking for Distributed Mining:** My background is in Python and AI, not distributed systems. A long-term vision is a P2P networking layer to allow multiple users to connect their instances and collectively "mine" a solution to a massive problem. If you have experience here, I would love to collaborate.
*   **Checkpoint Import/Export**: A basic version is implemented, but expanding this to allow saving a run mid-epoch would make the system more crash-resistant.

## What's Next?
The current focus is on polishing and debugging existing features to reach a beta phase. After that, the next iteration will introduce specialized modes and advanced capabilities:

*   **Story Telling Mode:** A dedicated mode for generating complex narratives, characters, and plots.
*   **World Simulation Mode:** For creating and simulating intricate worlds with consistent lore, physics, and histories, perfect for RPGs and theoretical systems.
*   **Recursive Module Stitching:** The initial implementation allows code validation and context feedback. The next step is to enable the system to design, code, and recursively assemble different software modules to create complex, full-stack applications from a high-level prompt.
*   **Export your QNN:** This is now implemented! You can import and export your QNN in plain JSON format, so other people can prompt it, at just a few MBs of size.

## Hyperparameters & Hardware Guidelines ‚öôÔ∏è

*   **`CoT trace depth`**: The number of layers in your agent network.
*   **`Number of epochs`**: One full cycle of a forward and reflection pass.
*   **`Vector word size`**: The number of "seed verbs" for initial agent creation.
*   **`Number of Questions for Final Harvest`**: The number of questions the `interrogator` agent generates.
*   **`Prompt alignment` (0.1 - 2.0)**: How strongly an agent's career is influenced by the user's prompt.
*   **`Density` (0.1 - 2.0)**: Modulates the influence of the previous layer when creating new agents.
*   **`Learning rate` (0.1 - 2.0)**: Controls the magnitude of change an agent makes to its prompt.

#### Hardware Recommendations:
*   **CPU-Only Laptop (32GB RAM)**: 2x2 or 4x4 networks with 3-4 epochs are ideal.
*   **High-End Rig (64GB RAM + 24GB GPU)**: 6x6 up to 10x10 networks with 2-10 epochs should be doable in 20-45 minutes.

## Technical Setup

*   **Backend**: FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph, Ollama
*   **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Thanks.

# Preliminary results (no benchmarks, im poor)

### Prompt

```
Current diffusers and transformer architectures use integral samplers or differential solvers in the case of diffusers, and decoding algorithms which account as integral, in the case of transformers, to run inference; but never both together. I presume the foundation of training and architecture are allready figured out, so i want a new inference algorithm. For this conceptualization assume the world is full of spinning wheels (harmonic oscillators), like we see them in atoms, solar systems, galaxies, human hierarchies...etrc, and data represents a measured state of the "wheel" at a given time. Abudant training data samples the full state of the "wheel" by offering all the posible data of the wheels full state. This is where understanding is reached: by spinning the whole wheel.

¬†Current inference algoritms in the other hand, are not fully decoding the internal "implicit wheels" abstracted into the weights after training as they lack a feedback and harmonic mechanism as it is achieved by backprop during training. The training algorithms ‚Äúencodes‚Äù the wheels but inference algorithms do not extract them very well. Theres a massive information loss.

¬†I want you to make in python with excellent documentation:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†1. An inference algorithm that uses a PID like approach with perturbative feedback. Instead of just using either an integrative or differential component, i want you to implement both with proportional weighting terms. The inference algorithm should sample all its progressive output and feed it back into the transformer.

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†2. The inference algorithm should be coded from scratch without using external dependencies.

PID-Feedback Inference Engine for Implicit Dynamical Systems (Wheel-Inspired Framework)
===============================================================================

This module implements a novel inference algorithm inspired by the conceptualization of
a world composed of spinning wheels, where data represents measured states of these
"implicit wheels" abstracted within a trained transformer model. The core innovation
is a **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) feedback inference engine** that:

1. Uses both integral (accumulated state) and differential (rate of change) components
   with proportional weighting to guide inference.
2. Performs iterative, perturbative feedback by sampling progressive outputs and
   feeding them back into the transformer for refinement.
3. Operates entirely from scratch, without external dependencies (e.g., torch, numpy).
4. Simulates the detection and stabilization of latent dynamical behaviors (e.g., phase
   locking, resonance) through recursive feedback loops.

The algorithm is designed to decode the internal "implicit wheels" (latent dynamics)
that are abstracted into the model weights during training, overcoming the limitations
of shallow responses in traditional inference.

Key Features:
- Self-contained implementation using pure Python (no external libraries).
- PID-like control loop with adaptive proportional weighting.
- Progressive output sampling and feedback injection.
- Simulated latent state manifold tracking via residual stream emulation.
- Built-in perturbation and coherence validation for robustness.

Usage:
    1. Initialize the PIDInferenceEngine with a transformer-like function (e.g., a closure).
    2. Call `run_inference(input_sequence, max_steps=100)` to perform iterative inference.
    3. Access `results` for the final refined output and `history` for full trajectory.

Note: This is a conceptual simulation. In practice, the "transformer" would be a real model
with access to attention and residual stream activations. Here, we simulate it via a
state transition function.

PID-Adaptive Harmonic Inference Engine (PAHIE): A Conceptual Framework for
Resilient, Adaptive, and Coherent Inference via Spinning Wheel Dynamics

Author: Expert Code Synthesis Agent
Date: 2025
License: MIT

Description:
This is a fully self-contained, dependency-free Python implementation of a novel
inference algorithm inspired by the metaphor of "spinning wheels" (harmonic
oscillators) representing latent data states. The PAHIE (PID-Adaptive Harmonic
Inference Engine) synthesizes principles from control theory, dynamical systems,
and feedback learning to enable deep decoding of internal latent dynamics.

Key Features:
- Implements a hybrid PID-like inference engine with proportional, integral, and
  differential components, all dynamically weighted.
- Uses perturbative feedback from progressive outputs to iteratively refine
  inference, mimicking the idea of "spinning the whole wheel".
- Encodes data as phase-space states of harmonic oscillators (position + momentum).
- Dynamically adjusts control gains via adaptive weighting based on error
  trajectory and coherence metrics.
- Includes a meta-regularization protocol to detect entropy drift and prevent
  coherence collapse.
- Fully self-contained: no external dependencies (e.g., torch, numpy, etc.).

This implementation is conceptual and educational, designed to demonstrate
the core logic of a next-generation inference engine that goes beyond
traditional autoregressive or iterative sampling.

# New prompt

Comment: so far it made a good job at making the kind of shitty algorithm you find in IEEE transactions with 2 citations. Lets do a third run with one more epoch.

```
 Current diffusers and transformer architectures use integral samplers or differential solvers in the case of diffusers, and decoding algorithms which account as integral, in the case of transformers, to run inference. I presume the foundation of training and architecture are already figured out, so i want you to create a new inference algorithm that helps exsiting architectures acheive AGI. For this conceptualziation assume the world is full of spinning wheels (harmonic oscillators), like we see them in atoms, solar systems, galaxies, human hierarchies...etrc, and data represents a measured state of the "wheel" at a given time. Abudant training data samples the full state of the "wheel" by offering all the posible data of the wheel full state: many perspectives. This is where understanding is reached: by spinning the whole wheel and assimilating all possibly perspectives.

 Current inference algoritms in the other hand, are not fully decoding the internal "implicit wheels" abstracted into the weights after training, as their responses can be shallow. The training algorithms encode the wheels but inference algorithms do not extract them very well.

 I want you to make in python with excellent documentation:

1. An inference algorithm to achieve AGI through better inference using a PID like approach with perturbative feedback. Instead of just using either an integrative or differential component, i want you to implement both with proportional weighting terms. Figure out a good way to integrate PID loops into transformer inference so transformers learn on inference. 

 2. The inference algorithm should be coded from scratch without using external dependencies. The transformer algorithm this algorithm runs inference for shall be mocked.

"""
AGI-Inspired Inference Engine: Harmonic Oscillator-Driven Transformer Inference with PID Feedback

This module implements a novel inference algorithm designed to achieve AGI-level understanding by:
1. Modeling the world as a system of harmonic oscillators (spinning wheels)
2. Using a PID-like feedback loop to dynamically refine inference through proportional, integral, and differential components
3. Integrating self-supervised pattern detection (HTSE) to discover periodicities, symmetries, and emergent structures
4. Enabling transformers to "learn on inference" by continuously adapting their internal representations

The core innovation is the Harmonic Inference Loop (HIL), which:
- Uses micro-scale pattern detection to identify local oscillatory motifs
- Applies macro-scale symmetry inference to detect global invariants
- Induces emergent oscillators via a learnable Hamiltonian in latent space
- Employs a PID controller to balance exploration (differential), memory (integral), and stability (proportional)

This implementation is self-contained, dependency-free, and designed for integration with any transformer architecture.

AGI-Inference: A PID-Enhanced, Self-Validating Inference Framework for Transformers
Based on the Conceptualization of Harmonic Oscillators as Fundamental Units of Intelligence

This module implements a novel inference algorithm designed to unlock AGI-level understanding in existing transformer architectures by:
1. Modeling data as states of spinning harmonic oscillators (wheels) in phase space.
2. Using a PID-like feedback loop with proportional, integral, and differential components to dynamically decode internal "implicit wheels" during inference.
3. Enabling transformers to learn *during* inference through perturbative feedback, mimicking the process of "spinning the wheel" to assimilate all perspectives.

The framework is fully self-contained, dependency-free, and includes a mocked transformer for demonstration.

Key Innovations:
- PID-Inference Loop: Proportional (P) for immediate response, Integral (I) for cumulative understanding, Differential (D) for predictive anticipation.
- Perturbative Feedback: Injects small, controlled perturbations to explore latent dynamics and refine internal representations.
- Self-Validation: Uses spectral, topological, and phase coherence metrics to validate inferred harmonic structures.
- Closed-Loop Learning: The transformer updates its internal state during inference via feedback, enabling continuous learning.

This is a conceptual prototype for AGI inference, grounded in dynamical systems theory and meta-cognitive learning.
